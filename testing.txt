ft1.cfg
=======

Demonstrates the following,
1. Head and Tail crash failure
2. Master detecting failure and changing master state
3. Clients receiving the new head and tail updates
4. Server simulating message loss to server
5. Client resending lost messages

ft2.cfg
=======
Demonstrates the following,
1. Mid Server 'S' Crash
2. Master detecting mid server crash
3. Master co ordinating with S- and S+ to reconfigure the chain and propagate updates


ft3.cfg
=======

Demonstrates,
1. Mid Server Crash
2. Master detecting mid server crash
3. S+ crash, while master coordinating with S- and S+ for S crash
4. Master coordinating with S- and S++ to reconfigure the chain and propagate updates

ft4.cfg
=======

Demonstrates,
1. Mid Server Crash
2. Master detecting mid server crash
3. S- crash, while master coordinating with S- and S+ for S crash
4. Master coordinating with S-- and S+ to reconfigure the chain and propagate updates

ce1.cfg
=======

1. Mid server crash and reducing the chain length lesser than the threshold
2. Master detecting mid server crash and reconfiguring chain
3. Master detecting chain length lesser than threshold
4. Master creates new server and makes it as new tail
5. Master informs clients about the new tail


ce2.cfg
=======

1. Mid server crash and reducing the chain length lesser than the threshold
2. Master detecting mid server crash and reconfiguring chain
3. Master detecting chain length lesser than threshold
4. Master creates new server and makes it as new tail
5. Master informs clients about the new tail
6. The old tail crashes, when propagating updates to new tail
7. Master detects the old tail failure and treats it as MID server crash failure
8. Reconfigures the chain by eliminating the old tail

ce3.cfg
=======

1. Mid server crash and reducing the chain length lesser than the threshold
2. Master detecting mid server crash and reconfiguring chain
3. Master detecting chain length lesser than threshold
4. Master creates new server and makes it as new tail
5. Master informs clients about the new tail
6. The NEW tail crashes, when receiving updates from OLD tail
7. Master hence retains the OLD tail as the tail of the bank
